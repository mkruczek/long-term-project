# long-term-project

## project description
**TL,DR:**   
i am starting with POC (very messy code) and then i will refactor it to good quality code(hopefully).


This is a _long-term project_ to learn and practice software development on on-line shop example, like ebay, amazon, allegro, etc.
i think set up some kind of app is much simpler then maintain it, add new features, refactor it, etc.
so i will try to do it... try to imagine that we do not have any on-line shop (we have back to 90` :D ) and we want to create one.  
first with very basic features to allow to connection some sellers and buyers. will try to do this as POC - so some quick way to deliver something.
then i will try to refactor it to good quality code. not sure want this exactly mean...  
but for now i know that most challenging part is developing app witch is running on production, and i want to try to simulate it.

## loose thoughts and ideas
* road map
* trunk base development with feature flags and somehow simulate parallel development
* kubernetes
* some cloud provider (aws, gcp, azure)
* maybe one microservice in other language (python, nodejs, rust)
