# long-term-project

This is a _long-term project_ to learn and practice software development.
base on my experience i think set up some kind of app is much simpler then maintain it, add new features, refactor it, etc.
so i will try to do it... 

scope of this project is app for collect statistics about trading, like myfxbook.com or fxblue.com.
ofc this is not any competition for them, just my way to learn and practice software development.
