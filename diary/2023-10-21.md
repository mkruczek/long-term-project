### DDD first step

will add some domain model for statistic and  acl layer to prevent contamination of one domain model by another, external model.
i have this problem now that statistic base on trade model entirely, and to simplify work with statistic i want add new and new fields to trade model, but it's not good idea, because trade model is not statistic model, and statistic model is not trade model. so i need to create statistic model and use it in statistic layer, and trade model in trade layer. and i need to create acl layer to prevent contamination of statistic model by trade but ofc i need this field only at statistic layer.  
example here is 'SimplifiedResult' model, it's not trade model, it's statistic model. other example is that the statistic domain do not need 'ExternalID'. 
but first step is a first step... will do with kiss approach and we will see what will happen :D

and additional my project is developed by TrunkBaseDevelopment, so additional i need to create some kind of 'feature toggle' give me ability to switch on/off statistic work on statistic.Tade or domain.Trade.
