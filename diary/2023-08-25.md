# missed volume

i have missed very important stuff in xtb.CSV struct model.  
XTB has several options to export theirs data. i usually use basic format without info about volume. simply i do not need this data bacause i only focused on profit/loss at pips/points.  
but i think i should add this option to my model, because at the end this is quite important data.  
there is a little obstacle here. the info about volume i can get only from excel file.  
for now i have part of CSV import in my code.

### what i do...
as long this is a study project i think that this could be a good idea to finish CSV import (without volume) and then add excel import.  
there will be opportunity to crete some interface to import data from different sources, witch i can probably use in the future.  
also i need to figure out what to do with model when i do not have volume data.
