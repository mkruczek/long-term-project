### chart view - concept

my poc approach is new microservice that will be responsible for generating image with chart and trades on it.  
generating image will happen during adding new trade to the database.  for every trade will be sent event "trade_added", and chart view service will be listening for this event.  
when event will be received, service will generate image with chart and trades on it.
  
about generating image will try to do it with go/image package. have already some poc code for it, not ideal but should work.  
i know that there is some go package for generating charts, but i want try to do it with go/image package, because sounds like fun, to be honest :D .

after generating image, service will save it to the MinIO storage, and will save path to the image in the main database via event "chart_view_generated".
this event will be received by the main service, and will be saved in the database.  
when user will want to see chart view, main service will get path to the image from the database, and will send it to the user.
also will create some basic UI (with HTMX) for displaying all content

additionally works on this will be on separate branch, because i want to keep main branch available for other work.
