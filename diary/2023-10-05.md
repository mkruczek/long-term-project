### DDD

i have been participating in DDD training for the last three days... was grate and i have new idea :D...  
i would apply this approach at the beginning but instructor *[Micha≈Ç Michaluk](https://bottega.com.pl/trener-michal-michaluk)* (great man!!) shows me a better way to do it...
so time for refactoring :D... to achieve this point i only needed 3 months :D...
