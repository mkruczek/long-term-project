### DDD

i have been participating in DDD training for the last three days... was grate and i have new idea :D...  
i would apply this approach at the beginning but instructor *[Micha≈Ç Michaluk](https://bottega.com.pl/trener-michal-michaluk)* (great man!!) shows me a better way to do it...
so time for refactoring :D... to achieve this point i only needed 3 months :D...

i would like introduce two modules:
- "uplouder" - this module is responsible for uploading trades to the system
- "trades" - this module is responsible for viewing trades
- "statistics" - this module is responsible for calculating statistics

additionally i have started to see how my domain model Trade starts to be more and more complex, with more fields and more logic, and probably without separation it will be a mess with _"God object"_

if i am thinking correctly, will be the best if every module will have own database filled by events.
maybe something like this:
1) uplouder get data from _"some source"_ (csv, api, etc.)
2) will add row to database
3) will publish event with most important data (symbol, date, price, etc.)
4) trades and statistic will subscribe to this event and will add row to own database with data which they need (statistic for example will need externalID, ane trade will not need SimplifiedResult)
