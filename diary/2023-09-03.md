### price

during working on fixing the bug with calculation profit, i realized that my approach to "price" was also naive.  
i ofc know that the computer can't into decimal numbers, but i had hope that will be good enough.  
but after adding first "real" test case where open price was 1.28666, after converting it to int it became 128665.

```go

op := 1.28666
coeficient := 100000

opInt := int(op * float64(coeficient))
// opInt == 128665
```

so i had to change the approach.  
no sure what will be the best, but i alwasy want to try create a package to handle **money**.  
so will try to create a package for that and we will see how it will go :) .

p.s. maybe this will be nice open source library for go community in some time :lol:.
