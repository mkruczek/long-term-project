### DDD first step

ok, i am ready to introduce new microservice dedicated to statistics. but i do not have separated database for it, so for now i will use orginal database with acl layer witch still base on domain.Trade.
next step will be to create new database and move all statistics related data to it and add mechanism to synchronize data between databases, probably using events.
microservice Trade will send event* `added-trde`(and some others for update and delete) and statistics will listen to it and add new trade to its database in form of statistics.Trade.

*not sure what to use for this from technical point of view... but probably i would like use dapr for communication between service and environment. but watermill looks interesting too, and i would like to try it, but not know if they can work together.
