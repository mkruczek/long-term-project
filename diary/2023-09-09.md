### statistics

ok i have trades at db... so now i would like to see some statistics about them.  
in first place i would like to see how much i have earned/lost in a given period of time.  
for this i will add new endpoint at existing api...
but this project is the pre-everything project is a learning project so i will over engineer it a little bit.
will create a new microservice for statistics, and current service will be responsible only for uploading trades to
db.  
in my mind i have idea that this two microservice will be used some common stuff from domain layer.

maybe also i some how separate database for statistic and some how sync it via msg queue...
