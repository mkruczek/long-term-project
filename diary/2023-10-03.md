### win loss ratio

Win-Loss Ratio is a measure of the number of winning trades divided by the number of losing trades. It is a measure of the profitability of the trader.  
first, we need to define what is a winning trade and what is a losing trade.  
for every we have 3 options:
* win
* loss
* breakeven

ofc win or loss is clear, but what is breakeven?  in theory breakeven is when you close the trade at the same price you opened it. but in practice when our trade is will close 1 pip above or below the entry price and also we need to pay the spread to the broker, so we will have a small loss...  but not the same as a loss from SL level...  
what more tricky is that the different symbols have different spread, so can't just say that 1 pip below or above the entry price is breakeven.
