### statistics works :D

i have introduced a new feature to the statistics -> calculate the profit and averageProfit.  
i would like to keep "function" approach on the entire statistic package and not to use the "class" approach.  
this probably will be easier to maintain, add new features and to test.  
ofc i only mean abut public access to the package.  
in my mind i have somme values which i want return at _Summary_ struct:
- [x] profit
- [x] averageProfit
- [ ] averageDuration
- [ ] bestTrade
- [ ] worstTrade
- [ ] todo -> i will add more values later

i somehow want use goroutines to calculate those values in parallel.

oh... maybe i should add _duration_ to the _Trade_ struct :thinking:
