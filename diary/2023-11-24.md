### omg - what a stupid bug :facepalm:

during introducing statistic package and microservice i made a stupid mistake. for some shortcut i decide to use domain model also as presenter model for handler.  
and when i start testing the best and worst case was empty at http response... but ofc tests was green.
when i start to debug i ended at handler and trades was present... so far so good.
and now become my stupid mistake. json serializer was not able to serialize the statistic.Trade because fields was private :upside_down_face:  
a typical question from a recruitment interview and it's amazing how someone could make such a mistake. now i know :lol:

solution is easy, will introduce a presenter model and use this for handler and keep domain model for domain logic only.  
and will make presenter model lighter than domain model, not sure what i will cut out, but i will find something :wink:.
