### IDEAS & PROPOSAL*
<sub>* but maybe never happen :upsidedown: </sub>

* skip volume data in basic xtb import for some time, and then add it along with db migration
* in similar way add "XTB::" prefix to all existing trades in db to externalId column (after adding xtb import from xlsx, but before mt4 import)
* road map
* trunk base development with feature flags and somehow simulate parallel development
* kubernetes
* some cloud provider (aws, gcp, azure)
* maybe one microservice in other language (python, nodejs, rust)
